        <p>Hi, my name is David Vann and I'm a chemical engineering student at the University of Virginia who enjoys practicing
            programming, web development, and other computer science-related things in my free time. If you're interesting in learning
            more about me or seeing a more explicit resume, see the <a href="about.html">about</a> page. Other content on the website includes
            a more detailed look at <a href="projects.html">projects</a> I've worked on, <a href="works-writings.html">various works</a> I've
            done or contributed to, possibly including more blog-type posts at some point in the future, and <a href="photos.html">photos</a>
            I've taken that I like and want to share.
        </p>
