        <p>I've created this website to function as a testbed for learning web development skills as well
            as to display pictures I've taken (no comment on the quality of these pictures!) or whatever else
            I'm doing at the moment. I hope to eventually, after much work, be able to show this website to other
            people to display my worth, get a job, etc., etc.
        </p>
        <p>To learn web development, I've started by going through Mozilla's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">guide</a>
            and may additionally use <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/home">The Odin Project</a> as an additional resource at some point.</p>
        <h2>Planned Content</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pictures I've taken (especially nature photos, hence the header picture)</li>
            <li>Possibly some work I'm doing related to data science</li>
            <li>Maybe embedding a simple game (e.g., Pac-Man clone, tic-tac-toe, or something), 
                just to go through the process of doing so.</li>
            <li>Possibly some writings</li>
        </ul>
